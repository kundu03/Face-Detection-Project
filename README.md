# Face-Detection-Project
It is an opencv c++ project to detect faces in an image , a video or a webcam.
It uses a default haar cascade file called "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" which is a pre trained file to find and detect face.
NOTE : All the paths and files in the project are according to my system.
